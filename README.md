# economic_model
revenge against capitalism

programs needed: Netlogo and Java
runs can be programmed directly in XML (I'm not familiar tho, you?)

Netlogo has a built in Monte-Carlo simulator called behaviorspace: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/behaviorspace.html

to do:

- program the headless function of netlogo
- run the 3.6 million simulations
- create a pipeline for analyzing the results
